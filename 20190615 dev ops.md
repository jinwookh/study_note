# dev ops
- dev + ops

## cloud infra
- think about nobel prize website -> lots of traffic at special day -> we use cloud
- unstopped distribution

## blue-green deploy

## process
develop -> build(jenkins) -> package(dockerHub) -> cloud

## agile process
- splitting works



# system command
- man
- where is my application?
  - often works at local but not works at origin
## process
- programming in execution
- cput usage : ratio that takes over cpu time
- ps -ef : check if process is in execution
- ps -aux : check the percentae of process usage

## network
- nmap -PN daum.net -p80 | grep ^80 : does daum.net is opensing port 80?
- nmap localhost
- netstat -tnlp 
- iptables -nL --line-numbers
- netstat -nr
- route add default gw 192.168.0.1 dev eth0
- curl -X GET URL주소

## DISK CHECK
- df -h
- du -h --max-depth=1 ./
- watch

## LOG CHECK
- log can fill the threads

## why is the program slow?
- sync / async / blocking / nonblocking
- blocking : application is stopped because of io
- cpu / cache / memory /disk speed

### memory performance
- Vmstat
- iostat

## substitute python for shell script

## TICK STACK


# ML OPS
- 데이터 공급 -> 모델링 -> 서비스
- 똑같은 데이터에 대해 모델은 같은 결과를 내야 한다?
- version control system for ML project

# Windows Kubernetes
- why do we use Container?
